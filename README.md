## SQL Query: Top Customer Identification

This SQL query retrieves the customer ID of the top customer based on the number of orders they have placed. It selects the `CUSTOMER_ID` column from the `ORDERS` table, groups the results by `CUSTOMER_ID`, orders the groups by the count of orders in descending order and then by `CUSTOMER_ID` in ascending order, and limits the output to only the top customer with the most orders.

### Query Description:
- Selects the `CUSTOMER_ID` column from the `ORDERS` table.
- Groups the results by `CUSTOMER_ID`.
- Orders the groups by the count of orders in descending order and then by `CUSTOMER_ID` in ascending order.
- Limits the output to only the top customer with the most orders.

### Usage:
1. Run the SQL query against your database.
2. The query will return the customer ID of the top customer with the most orders.

### Notes:
- This query assumes the existence of an `ORDERS` table with a `CUSTOMER_ID` column.
- Modify the query as needed to suit your specific database schema and requirements.
